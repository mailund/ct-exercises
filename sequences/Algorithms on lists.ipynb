    "When we write a number such as 123 we usually mean this to be in base 10, that is, we implicitly understand this to be the number $3 \\times 10^0 + 2 \\times 10^1 + 1 \\times 10^2$. Starting from the right and moving towards the left, each digit represents an increasing power of tens. The number *could* also be in octal, although then we would usually write it like $123_8$. If the number was in octal, each digit would represent a power of eight, and the number should be understood as $3\\times 8^0 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 3 \\times 8^2$.\n",

    "Binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers--notation where the bases are 2, 8, and 16, respectively--are frequently used in (low-level) computer science as they are good choice for describing patterns of bits as well as numbers. Base 12, called duodecimal, has been proposed as a better choice than base 10 for doing arithmetic because 12 has more factors than 10 and this system would be easier to do multiplication and division in.\n",

One way to represent a list of indices is as a binary sequence. The indices of the bits that are 1 should be included, the indices where the bits are 0 should not.
